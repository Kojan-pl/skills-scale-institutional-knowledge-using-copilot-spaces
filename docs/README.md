# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains the official process documentation for OctoAcme's project management practices. It is the single source of truth for how cross-functional teams at OctoAcme initiate, plan, execute, and close projects. Use these docs to onboard new team members, align stakeholders, and maintain consistent delivery standards across all initiatives.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, customer-first project management approach designed for cross-functional teams delivering product features, services, and integrations. Projects move through a defined lifecycle—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective—supported by standardized artifacts such as the Project Charter, Sprint Backlog, Risk Register, and Release Plan. Each phase has clear entry and exit criteria to ensure teams build the right things, in the right order, with the right quality.

Three core roles drive delivery at OctoAcme: the **Project Manager (PM)**, who coordinates schedules, risks, and communications; the **Product Manager (PdM)**, who owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success; and **Developers**, who implement features, maintain tests, and participate in design and code reviews. Supporting these roles are QA, stakeholders, and sponsors who provide oversight, validation, and approvals at key milestones. Clear role ownership and accountability are central to how OctoAcme avoids ambiguity and keeps projects on track.

Communication is kept consistent through a regular cadence: weekly PM–PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates, with ad-hoc escalations routed through a defined path (Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor). Risk is managed proactively via a living Risk Register reviewed at every weekly sync. Stakeholder updates are driven from a single source of truth—typically the project README or release doc—to prevent information fragmentation.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the lifecycle rather than treated as a final gate. Acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done are agreed upon during planning, developers write and maintain tests alongside code, and each release is validated before announcement. Retrospectives close every project cycle, capturing learnings and feeding them back into process improvements so that OctoAcme teams continuously raise the bar on delivery quality and team health.
